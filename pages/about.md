# **About Me**

Hi there, I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br><br>
I'm a London based Front End/UI engineer who enjoys crafting great user experience. From End-to-End build to bug fixes, no job is too big or small for me. With over a decade of experience in web development, I'm always striving to improve my skillsets :nerd_face:
